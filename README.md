# AutoDeployX - Full Project Documentation

## üß≠ Overview

**AutoDeployX** is a self-service DevOps SaaS platform designed to automate the CI/CD lifecycle. It integrates Git-based repositories, pipelines, containerized builds, and Kubernetes deployments with full observability and rollback capabilities. This platform is built with a modern stack: **Golang (microservices)**, **React.js**, **NGINX**, and **Kubernetes**, and supports seamless DevOps workflows. Now enhanced with **AI-powered features** for smart pipeline suggestions, anomaly detection, intelligent notifications, and failure prediction.

---

## üéØ Objectives

* Automate application delivery from Git push to deployment
* Provide developers with a dashboard to monitor and manage deployments
* Offer deep observability and rollback functionality
* Support multi-user environments with RBAC and Git integration
* Enhance usability and intelligence using AI-driven features

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Microservices Architecture

Each service is containerized and communicates via REST/gRPC and message queues (NATS or Kafka).

**Services:**

1. **User Service** - OAuth login, user management, RBAC
2. **Repo Watcher Service** - Listens to Git webhooks
3. **Pipeline Orchestrator** - Manages pipeline DAGs, job status
4. **Build Agent Service** - Executes containerized build jobs
5. **Deploy Manager** - Applies Helm/Kustomize manifests to K8s
6. **Metrics Collector** - Gathers Prometheus and K8s metrics
7. **Notification Service** - Sends email/Slack alerts
8. **WebSocket Gateway** - Real-time updates to frontend
9. **AI Assistant Service** - Provides pipeline suggestions, detects anomalies, predicts failures, and assists with troubleshooting

**Infrastructure:**

* Kubernetes (EKS/GKE/Minikube)
* NGINX Ingress Controller
* Cert-manager (TLS)
* PostgreSQL (user data, pipelines)
* Redis (queue/cache)
* Object Storage (S3-compatible)
* **Vagrant (Local Dev VMs)**: Automates consistent dev environments
* **Ansible**: Automates provisioning and deployment (e.g., VM setup, secrets config)

## ü§ñ AI Features

### 1. AI-Powered Pipeline YAML Generator

* Analyzes code repositories to suggest or auto-generate `.autodeployx.yaml`
* Utilizes OpenAI API or local LLM (e.g., LLaMA2 via Ollama)
* Can generate templates based on detected frameworks (e.g., Go, Node.js, Python)

### 2. Anomaly Detection

* Monitors pipeline metrics (duration, failures, retries)
* Detects unusual behavior using Isolation Forests or statistical baselines
* Sends alerts and surfaces anomalies in the dashboard

### 3. Failure Prediction

* Uses historical logs and pipeline metadata to predict job failure probability in real-time
* Integrates with telemetry to identify high-risk patterns
* Warns users and suggests corrective actions during execution

### 4. Intelligent Notifications

* Provides context-aware alerts with resolution suggestions
* Slack/Email/Webhook integrations support inline diagnostics

### 5. Contextual AI Chat Assistant

* Embedded in CLI and dashboard
* Can answer queries like:

  * "Why did my build fail?"
  * "Suggest a pipeline for a React app with Docker"
  * "Compare two pipeline runs"

* Runs inside isolated container (DinD or Firecracker)
* Streams build logs

### 5. Deploy Manager

* Authenticates to target K8s cluster
* Uses Helm or Kustomize for deployments
* Rollbacks on failure

### 6. Metrics Collector

* Exposes Prometheus endpoints
* Gathers resource usage, pod state
* Aggregates cost estimates

### 7. Notification Service

* Uses templated alerts
* Configurable per pipeline/project

### 8. AI Assistant Service

* Uses LLM (via API or open-source model)
* Auto-generates pipeline YAMLs based on repo structure
* Predicts pipeline failures using historical data and telemetry
* Anomaly detection on performance metrics
* Context-aware chat assistant for CLI and dashboard
* Responds to troubleshooting queries and surfaces recommendations
